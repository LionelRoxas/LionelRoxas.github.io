UHSpace is a web and mobile application designed by students at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Our platform is a dynamic discovery tool designed to connect students across all grade levels with fellow students, employers, and mentors. It enables students to showcase their projects, collaborate with peers, and gain real-world experience. Additionally, the platform provides a space for employers and clients to post job or project opportunities, allowing our team to match these with qualified student groups, fostering valuable connections and hands-on learning experiences.

UHSpace is implemented using <strong>React Native</strong> for building cross-platform mobile applications and <strong>Firebase</strong> for backend services, including authentication, real-time database, and cloud storage. 

In this project, I gained experience with full-stack application design and associated technologies, including <strong>Firebase</strong> for database storage and user authentication, <strong>React Native</strong> for building responsive user interfaces, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> for both client and server-side programming. Our goal is to create an intuitive, seamless experience that empowers students to connect, collaborate, and thrive in their academic and professional endeavors.
