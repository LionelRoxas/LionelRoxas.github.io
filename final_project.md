UHM Marketplace is a web application developed as a final project for ICS 314 (Software Engineering I) at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. Our platform serves as a secure and user-friendly marketplace specifically designed for the UH community, enabling students and staff to buy, sell, and trade various items from textbooks to electronics.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to create a marketplace that addresses the unique needs of the UH community while implementing software engineering best practices and modern web technologies. We focused on creating a platform that is:

- **Secure**: Requiring UH email (@hawaii.edu) verification
- **User-friendly**: Implementing intuitive navigation and clean design
- **Efficient**: Providing robust search and filter capabilities
- **Community-focused**: Facilitating trusted transactions within the UH community

- **Linear**: For agile project management and issue tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: For continuous integration and deployment

## Development Process

We followed agile methodologies learned in ICS 314:

1. **Issue Tracking**: Utilized Linear for task management and sprint planning
2. **Version Control**: Implemented GitHub flow for collaborative development
3. **Code Reviews**: Conducted peer reviews to maintain code quality
4. **Testing**: Implemented Playwright for end-to-end testing
5. **Documentation**: Maintained comprehensive documentation for future maintenance

## Key Features

The platform includes essential marketplace functionalities:
